Seeds:
	[ ]Seed can be planted to produce a sapling of the correct species
	[ ]Can't plant next to existing tree or sapling
	[ ]Crafting recipe works for dirtbucket and produces correct species
	[ ]Spawn from tree edge
	[ ]Plant themselves randomly
	
Sapling:
	[ ]Sapling transitions to tree structure
	[ ]Sapling produces the correct tree species
	[ ]Sapling returns seed when supporting block is removed

Trees:
	[ ]Tree produces more branches than the default single block trunk
	[ ]Tree grows
	[ ]Branching occurs
	[ ]Soil life is decremented as growing occurs
	[ ]Tree stops growing after soil is depleted
	[ ]Cocoa pods voluntarily generate on planted JungleTrees
	[ ]Cocoa pods can be manually planted on JungleTree trunks(full size blocks)

Harvesting:
	[ ]Harvesting tree results in wood of the proper species
	[ ]Harvesting tree results in nearly all leaves blocks being destroyed.
	[ ]The proper seeds fall from leaves blocks after a harvest.

Branches:
	[ ]Branches without supporting leaves properly rot
	[ ]Breaking a branch will cause the outward branches to collapse
	[ ]Burning a branch will cause the outward branches to collapse
	[ ]Detonating TNT by trees will not result in floating fragments

Leaves:
	[ ]Leaves die in the dark
	[ ]Leaves die when there are no branches
	[ ]Leaves spawn from a bare end branch
	[ ]Crushing leaves results in expected drops(seeds)

Potions:
	[ ]Potion can be applied anywhere on the tree including the rooty dirt block(leaves blocks don't count)
	[ ]Burgeoning potion quickly grows tree
	[ ]Bone meal increases soil life
	
WorldGen:
	[ ]Tree branches do not connect between neighbors(correct spacing)
	[ ]Vines generate on JungleTrees
	[ ]Cocoa pods generate on JungleTrees
	[ ]Undergrowth generates under JungleTrees
	[ ]Swamp Oaks generate in Swamp biomes in shallow water.
	[ ]Vines generate on Swamp Oaks
	
Woodland Staff:
	[ ]Captures JoCodes
	[ ]Plant JoCodes
	[ ]Respects rotation
	[ ]Pull species without overwriting the JoCodes
